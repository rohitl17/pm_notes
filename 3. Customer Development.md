## 3. Customer Development

### What is Customer Development
- Systematic process for validating assumptions about users and markets.
- **Four stages:**
  1. **Customer Discovery:** Do they have the problem?
  2. **Customer Validation:** Will they pay?
  3. **Customer Creation:** How to reach and acquire them?
  4. **Company Building:** Can we scale it?

### The Four Types of Interviews
1. **Exploratory:** Discover problems and workflows.
2. **Validation:** Test if your solution fits their needs.
3. **Product Feedback:** Evaluate current product usability.
4. **Post-launch:** Measure satisfaction and retention.

### Who to Talk To
- Representative users
- Mix of:
  - Power users
  - New users
  - Churned users
- Find them via LinkedIn, Reddit, Slack communities, mailing lists, or internal teams.

### Getting Them to Talk
- Make outreach **personal, specific, and respectful of time**.
- Offer value: early access, recognition, gratitude.
- Avoid “salesy” tone — express genuine curiosity.

### Running Good Interviews
- Don’t pitch. Listen.
- Ask **open-ended questions**: “Tell me about the last time you…”
- Take notes, record with permission, and extract key quotes.
- Summarize themes after multiple interviews.

### Good vs. Bad Questions
- ✅ Good: “How do you currently solve this?”
- ✅ Good: “What frustrates you about your current process?”
- ❌ Bad: “Would you use this feature?”
- ❌ Bad: “Do you like this idea?”

### Building User Personas
- Personas = fictional but evidence-based profiles of key user types.
- Include: goals, motivations, pain points, context, behavior.
- Derived from interview data — not imagination.
- Use personas to guide prioritization and feature design.

### The PM and the Data Diet
- Combine **qualitative (interviews)** and **quantitative (analytics)** insights.
- Data shows *what’s happening*; interviews reveal *why it’s happening*.
- Maintain a balanced “data diet” — empathy and numbers together.
