## 3. Customer Development

## What is Customer Development?
- A structured process for **discovering and validating customer problems** before building solutions.
- Primary goal: **learn** — confirm that a real problem exists and that people care enough to use/pay for a solution.
- Emphasis: **listen > pitch**. Validate problems and assumptions, not sell features.

## The Four Types of Interviews

| Interview Type | Goal | When to use | Typical focus |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **Exploratory** | Discover pain points, workflows, context | Early-stage research | "Tell me about the last time you did X." |
| **Validation** | Test if a problem/need is real and important | After hypotheses form | Willingness to adopt/pay; priority of problem |
| **Solution / Feedback** | Get reactions to prototypes/MVPs | After a prototype or mock | Usability, value, suggested improvements |
| **Relationship / Ongoing** | Track changing needs and deeper insights | Post-launch / with power users | Longitudinal changes, roadmap input |

---

## Key Differences: Customer Dev vs Sales
| Sales Interview | Customer Development Interview |
|---|---|
| Goal: close a deal | Goal: learn and validate |
| You pitch and persuade | You ask and listen |
| Outcome measured by conversion | Outcome measured by insight & patterns |
| Questions may be leading | Questions should be open-ended and unbiased |

---

## Who You Should Talk To
- Mix of: **existing users**, **potential users**, **competitors’ users**, and **industry experts**.
- Include both **users** (people who use the product) and **customers** (people who pay or decide).
- Avoid only talking to friends/colleagues (selection bias).
- Target: **5–10 strong interviews per segment** to start seeing patterns.

---

## Finding Interviewees — External
- Channels:
  - LinkedIn outreach (search job titles / industries)
  - Reddit, specialized forums, Slack/Discord groups
  - Facebook groups, Twitter/X, Meetup / Event attendees
  - Customer review sites (find reviewers, reach out)
- Tactics:
  - Post in community threads asking for help / research participants
  - Offer value: small honorarium, early access, or summary of learnings
  - Use targeted search + polite cold outreach message

---

## Finding Interviewees — Internal
- Sources:
  - Customer Success / Support ticket lists (repeat issues)
  - Sales team (recent closed/won or lost deals)
  - Product analytics (power users, churned users)
  - Partnerships & existing enterprise contacts
- Tactics:
  - Ask CS or Sales for intros to customers who fit the persona
  - Use internal newsletters or product beta lists to recruit

---

## How to Get Them to Talk (Outreach & Email)
**Principles**
- Be short, personal, and specific.
- Make it about their experience — explicitly say **no sales pitch**.
- Propose a clear time commitment (e.g., 15–20 minutes).
- Give an incentive if appropriate.

## 🔍 The Four Steps of Customer Development

| Step | Description | Key Question |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **1. Customer Discovery** | Understand the problem and validate that it exists. | Do people care about this problem? |
| **2. Customer Validation** | Test whether your solution solves that problem. | Will people pay for this? |
| **3. Customer Creation** | Scale customer acquisition; focus on demand generation. | How do we grow efficiently? |
| **4. Company Building** | Transition from learning → execution mode. | How do we operationalize this? |

---

## 🧠 Customer Discovery

### **Objective:**  
Find out whether your assumptions about customers and their problems are *actually true*.

### **Key Tactics**
- Conduct **problem interviews** (not solution demos).  
- Focus on **customer behavior**, not opinions.  
- Look for **patterns**, not isolated anecdotes.

### **Questions to Ask**
- What’s the biggest challenge you face when doing ___?
- How do you currently solve that?
- What happens if you don’t fix it?
- How much does that problem cost you (time/money)?
- Who else is affected by this issue?

## 🧪 Customer Validation

### **Objective:**  
Validate that your product (MVP) solves the problem and customers are willing to pay.

### **Key Tactics**
- Create an MVP and test it with early adopters.
- Use pre-orders, landing pages, or fake-door tests.
- Gather **behavioral data**, not just survey responses.

### **Signs of Validation**
✅ Users pay, even for a prototype  
✅ Strong word-of-mouth or referrals  
✅ Users come back or integrate it in workflows  

---

## 🚀 Customer Creation

### **Objective:**  
Build predictable, repeatable sales and marketing channels.

### **Tactics**
- Identify scalable acquisition channels (SEO, ads, referrals, etc.)
- Refine messaging using insights from validated customers.
- Track **CAC**, **LTV**, and **conversion rates**.

## ✉️ Practice Writing Emails

- **Keep subject lines actionable** (e.g., “15-min chat about [topic]?”)
- **Personalize first sentence** (reference a post, review, or recent event)
- **State time commitment** and mention “no sales” clearly
- **Provide timeslots or a link** to schedule (e.g., Calendly)

## 🎤 How to Run a Customer Interview (Step-by-step)

### 🧾 Prepare
- Define **interview objective** & 3–5 high-priority questions  
- Share **context** and get **consent to record** (if recording)

---

### 🌤️ Warm-up (2–3 min)
- Build rapport: brief intro, non-threatening small talk

---

### ⚙️ Core (10–15 min)
- Ask about **past behavior** (e.g., “Tell me about the last time…”)
- Use **open-ended prompts**  
- Use **silence** to let them expand
- Dig for specifics: frequency, time spent, workarounds, emotion

---

### 🔍 Probe
- Use follow-ups:
  - “Why was that hard?”
  - “What did you try next?”
  - “Who else was involved?”

---

### 🔚 Close (2–3 min)
- Ask for referrals: “Who else should I talk to?”
- Ask permission to follow up with clarifying questions

---

### 🗒️ After
- Summarize notes within 24 hours
- Tag quotes, pain points, and any signals of **willingness to pay or adopt**

---

## 🧭 Interview Etiquette

- Record only **with permission**
- Don’t pitch or mention your solution early
- **Listen more than you talk** (>70% listening)
- Capture **verbatim quotes** where possible

---

## ❓ Good Questions vs Bad Questions

| **Good (Unbiased)** | **Bad (Leading / Hypothetical)** |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| “Tell me about the last time you experienced X.” | “Would you use a product that does X?” |
| “How do you currently solve this problem?” | “Would you pay $Y for this?” |
| “What’s the hardest part about X?” | “Do you think this is a good idea?” |
| “Can you walk me through the steps you took?” | “If we built feature Z, would that help?” |

> **Rule:** Ask about **past behavior and specifics**, not opinions about future behavior.

---

## 👤 Build User Personas from Interviews

### 🎯 Persona Template (Fields)

- **Name (archetype):** e.g., “Marketing Mary”  
- **Role / demographics**  
- **Goals**  
- **Main frustrations / pains**  
- **Current solutions / workarounds**  
- **Frequency & context of use**  
- **Motivators & objections**  
- **Representative quote**

---

### 🧩 Example Persona

| **Field** | **Example** |
|------------|-------------|
| Name | Marketing Mary |
| Role | Growth Marketer at SaaS startup |
| Goal | Reduce CAC and increase trial-to-paid conversion |
| Pain | Manual attribution and time-consuming A/B setup |
| Workaround | Spreadsheets + Google Analytics events |
| Quote | “I spend half my week reconciling data instead of testing.” |

---

### 🌍 Real-world Persona Examples (Brief)

- **Slack:** Team leads who value reduced meeting load and faster async communication  
- **Airbnb:** Hosts who require reliable bookings and safety assurances — *trust & simplicity are key*

---

## 📊 The Product Manager and the Data Diet

Combine **qualitative interviews** with **quantitative data**:

- Metrics tell the **“what”** (drop-offs, churn)  
- Interviews explain the **“why”**

### 🕓 Suggested Cadence
- Weekly quick interviews or readouts  
- Daily/weekly metric reviews

> Use both sources to form better hypotheses and **prioritize experiments**.

---

## 🧩 Evaluating & Synthesizing Insights

- Look for **patterns** across interviews (frequency of pain, intensity, workarounds)
- Map **assumptions to evidence**: confirmed / unconfirmed / contradicted
- Convert insights into **concrete next steps**:
  - Prioritize experiments  
  - Design MVPs  
  - Create personas  
  - Adjust roadmap priorities
