## 1. Product Lifecycle

### Four Major Phases
1. **Introduction**
   - Product is launched; low awareness and slow growth.
   - Focus: Positioning, early adopters, market education.
2. **Growth**
   - Sales accelerate; competition increases.
   - Focus: Scaling, differentiation, customer acquisition.
3. **Maturity**
   - Market saturation; growth slows.
   - Focus: Retention, optimization, new features or markets.
4. **Decline**
   - Market or technology shifts make product obsolete.
   - Focus: Decide between rejuvenation, pivot, or discontinuation.

### Real-world Examples
| Phase | Example | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Introduction | Uber (early SF launch) | Testing concept, small user base |
| Growth | Instagram post-Facebook acquisition | Rapid scale and user adoption |
| Maturity | iPhone | Incremental innovation and retention |
| Decline | iPod | Replaced by multi-functional iPhone |

## 2. Product Development Process

### Key Phases
1. **Ideation** – Identify user pain points, brainstorm solutions.  
2. **Research** – Validate assumptions with data and interviews.  
3. **Planning** – Define scope, roadmap, success metrics.  
4. **Development** – Design, build, test iteratively.  
5. **Launch** – Go-to-market, collect metrics.  
6. **Iteration** – Learn, refine, and improve continuously.

### Development Methodologies
- **Lean:** Build → Measure → Learn → Repeat. Eliminate waste, validate fast.
- **Agile:** Iterative development focused on user feedback.
- **Scrum:** Agile framework using sprints, daily standups, backlog, retrospectives.
- **Kanban:** Continuous flow; visualize tasks, limit work in progress (WIP).
- **Waterfall:** Sequential, fixed-scope model; best for regulated or hardware industries.

### Real-world Examples
| Methodology | Example | Use Case |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| Waterfall | Aerospace, Construction | Clear requirements, strict regulation |
| Agile | Slack, Spotify | Rapid iteration and user feedback |
