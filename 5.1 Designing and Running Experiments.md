# MVP Techniques — Notes

## 1. MVP techniques: Emails, shadows, 404, and coming soon
### Key ideas
- MVPs are experiments to **test demand and assumptions** quickly and cheaply.
- You can validate interest **without building the product** by creating signals that measure intent.

### Techniques covered
- **Email tests**
  - Send a short message describing the value proposition or offering a waitlist.
  - Measure open rates, click-throughs, and replies as signals of interest.
- **Shadow buttons**
  - Place a clickable UI element for a feature that doesn't exist yet.
  - Track clicks to measure demand; respond with “coming soon” or invite to beta.
- **404 / Coming Soon pages**
  - Create pages or links for features that don’t exist yet to measure visits and signups.
  - Use CTAs on "coming soon" pages to capture prospective users' emails.
- **Principle**
  - Focus on **learning signals** (clicks, signups, replies) rather than polished delivery.

## 2. More MVP techniques: Explainer, fake landing page, and pitch experiments
### Key ideas
- Test messaging and perceived value **before** building the product.
- Use simple artifacts to simulate product presence and measure reaction.

### Techniques covered
- **Explainer videos**
  - Short demos showing the product concept and how it solves the problem.
  - Measure signups or interest after people watch the video (Dropbox example).
- **Fake landing pages**
  - Build a realistic landing page describing the product, features, and pricing.
  - Use analytics and signup CTAs to measure conversion and interest.
  - Good for testing positioning, pricing hints, and headline effectiveness.
- **Pitch experiments**
  - Present the idea verbally or with slide decks to potential customers or stakeholders.
  - Observe questions, objections, and enthusiasm as validation signals.

## 3. Even more MVP techniques: Concierge, piecemeal, and Wizard of Oz
### Key ideas
- Deliver the promised value **manually** or by stitching tools together to learn the real user need and workflow.
- These techniques let you observe real behavior and refine the product before automating.

### Techniques covered
- **Concierge MVP**
  - Manually perform the service for early customers (high-touch).
  - Learn user needs deeply and uncover edge cases.
- **Piecemeal MVP**
  - Combine off-the-shelf tools and services (e.g., forms, spreadsheets, Zapier) to simulate product flows.
  - Rapidly prototype end-to-end experience without building infrastructure.
- **Wizard of Oz MVP**
  - Make the product appear automated while humans do the backend work.
  - Useful to test UX and demand for complex features before engineering automation.

## 4. Email-based MVPs
### Key ideas
- Email is a low-friction channel to validate interest and measure early traction.
- It’s effective for testing messaging, segmentation, and call-to-action effectiveness.

### Tactics
- **Write a targeted email** describing the problem and proposed solution; include a clear CTA (signup, reply, schedule).
- **Segment recipients** to test different value props or audiences.
- **Measure**: open rate, click-through rate, reply rate, conversion to signups or meeting bookings.
- **Follow-up flow**: use follow-up emails to re-engage and test persistence of interest.
- **Interpretation**: a high engagement signal indicates potential product-market fit; low engagement suggests rework on value proposition or audience.
