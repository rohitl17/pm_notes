# MVP Techniques — Notes

## 1. MVP techniques: Emails, shadows, 404, and coming soon
### Key ideas
- MVPs are experiments to **test demand and assumptions** quickly and cheaply.
- You can validate interest **without building the product** by creating signals that measure intent.

### Techniques covered
- **Email tests**
  - Send a short message describing the value proposition or offering a waitlist.
  - Measure open rates, click-throughs, and replies as signals of interest.
- **Shadow buttons**
  - Place a clickable UI element for a feature that doesn't exist yet.
  - Track clicks to measure demand; respond with “coming soon” or invite to beta.
- **404 / Coming Soon pages**
  - Create pages or links for features that don’t exist yet to measure visits and signups.
  - Use CTAs on "coming soon" pages to capture prospective users' emails.
- **Principle**
  - Focus on **learning signals** (clicks, signups, replies) rather than polished delivery.

## 2. More MVP techniques: Explainer, fake landing page, and pitch experiments
### Key ideas
- Test messaging and perceived value **before** building the product.
- Use simple artifacts to simulate product presence and measure reaction.

### Techniques covered
- **Explainer videos**
  - Short demos showing the product concept and how it solves the problem.
  - Measure signups or interest after people watch the video (Dropbox example).
- **Fake landing pages**
  - Build a realistic landing page describing the product, features, and pricing.
  - Use analytics and signup CTAs to measure conversion and interest.
  - Good for testing positioning, pricing hints, and headline effectiveness.
- **Pitch experiments**
  - Present the idea verbally or with slide decks to potential customers or stakeholders.
  - Observe questions, objections, and enthusiasm as validation signals.

## 3. Even more MVP techniques: Concierge, piecemeal, and Wizard of Oz
### Key ideas
- Deliver the promised value **manually** or by stitching tools together to learn the real user need and workflow.
- These techniques let you observe real behavior and refine the product before automating.

### Techniques covered
- **Concierge MVP**
  - Manually perform the service for early customers (high-touch).
  - Learn user needs deeply and uncover edge cases.
- **Piecemeal MVP**
  - Combine off-the-shelf tools and services (e.g., forms, spreadsheets, Zapier) to simulate product flows.
  - Rapidly prototype end-to-end experience without building infrastructure.
- **Wizard of Oz MVP**
  - Make the product appear automated while humans do the backend work.
  - Useful to test UX and demand for complex features before engineering automation.

## 4. Email-based MVPs
### Key ideas
- Email is a low-friction channel to validate interest and measure early traction.
- It’s effective for testing messaging, segmentation, and call-to-action effectiveness.

### Tactics
- **Write a targeted email** describing the problem and proposed solution; include a clear CTA (signup, reply, schedule).
- **Segment recipients** to test different value props or audiences.
- **Measure**: open rate, click-through rate, reply rate, conversion to signups or meeting bookings.
- **Follow-up flow**: use follow-up emails to re-engage and test persistence of interest.
- **Interpretation**: a high engagement signal indicates potential product-market fit; low engagement suggests rework on value proposition or audience.

## 5. Shadow Buttons

### Concept  
Shadow buttons are *fake feature triggers* used to measure user intent before a feature is actually built.

### How It Works
- Add a button or link (e.g., “Try Now” or “Get Early Access”) for a feature that doesn’t exist yet.  
- When clicked, show a message like:  
  > “Thanks for your interest — we’re still working on this feature!”  
- Measure click-through rate to gauge actual demand.

### Why It’s Useful
- Validates *real behavior*, not opinions.  
- Fast and low-cost way to estimate interest before committing resources.

## 6. 404 and Coming Soon MVPs

### Concept  
Use *“coming soon”* or *fake 404-style pages* to test market demand for new products or ideas.

### How It Works
- Create a “Coming Soon” landing page describing your product’s value proposition.  
- Include a sign-up form or email waitlist to measure interest.  
- A “404 MVP” redirects visitors after they click a link or ad for a non-existent product, then tracks engagement.

### Why It’s Useful
- Quickly validates demand before full product development.  
- Captures potential customer contacts early for follow-up research.

---

## 7. Explainer Videos**

### Concept  
A short, engaging video that explains what your product does — used to gauge understanding and interest.

### How It Works
- Record a brief walkthrough showing your product’s concept, workflow, and benefits.  
- Share it on landing pages or social platforms.  
- Track metrics like watch time, sign-ups, and comments for validation.

### Why It’s Useful
- Tests the clarity of your value proposition.  
- Helps visualize the concept without building it.

## 8. Piecemeal MVPs

### Concept  
Assemble your MVP using *existing tools or services* instead of building everything from scratch.

### How It Works
- Combine existing software like Google Sheets, Zapier, Typeform, and Notion.  
- Automate where possible, but keep manual effort where needed.  
- Focus on validating user behavior, not scaling.

### Why It’s Useful
- Launches faster and cheaper.  
- Tests core assumptions before investing in full infrastructure.

## 9. Concierge Service MVPs

### Concept  
Manually deliver your product or service to a few customers instead of automating it.

### How It Works
- Offer a *done-for-you* experience that mimics your final product’s value.  
- Collect rich qualitative feedback from direct interaction.  
- Observe what customers really need and value.

### Why It’s Useful
- Helps uncover hidden customer needs.  
- Builds strong early relationships with users.  
- Ideal for early validation of complex ideas.

## **How Big Companies Think About MVP Experiments**

### Concept  
Large companies use MVPs strategically to reduce risk and accelerate innovation — even at scale.

### Key Takeaways
- MVPs are used for *internal innovation testing* and *external feature validation*.  
- Big firms focus on:
  - Measurable success metrics.
  - Gradual rollouts and A/B testing.
  - Using brand trust to get faster feedback loops.

### Why It’s Useful
- Reinforces that *lean experimentation* isn’t just for startups.  
- MVP thinking helps enterprises move faster and stay customer-focused.

## **Evaluating Results and Learning from Them**

### Concept  
Once MVP data is collected, the goal is to *learn* — not just to succeed or fail.

### How It Works
1. Review metrics and qualitative feedback.  
2. Compare outcomes against your hypothesis and Minimum Success Criteria (MCS).  
3. Categorize assumptions:
   - ✅ **Validated** — data supports it.  
   - ❌ **Invalidated** — data contradicts it.  
   - ⚙️ **Unclear** — needs more testing.  
4. Document learnings and plan the next experiment.

### Why It’s Useful
- Ensures continuous iteration and data-driven decision-making.  
- Prevents emotional bias in interpreting MVP outcomes.
