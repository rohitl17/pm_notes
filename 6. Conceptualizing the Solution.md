## 1. Introduction to Wireframing

### 🎯 Key Concepts
- **Wireframing** is the *blueprint* of a digital product — it defines *structure and layout*, not design or color.
- It’s used to visualize how users will interact with your product before any code or design is done.
- The focus is on **usability**, **information hierarchy**, and **navigation flow**.

### 🧩 Why Wireframes Matter
- Helps teams quickly **test ideas** and **align on structure**.
- Reduces time and cost by catching UX issues early.
- Allows for **iterative feedback** without the distraction of visual details.

### 🛠 Tools for Wireframing
- **Low-fidelity:** Pen & paper, Balsamiq.
- **High-fidelity:** Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD.
- Choose based on **stage** (early = low fidelity, late = high fidelity).

### 💡 Tips
- Focus on *content placement* and *interaction flow*.
- Don’t spend time styling — grayscale layouts are ideal.
- Validate flow with stakeholders before prototyping.

## 2. Wireframe, Mockup, Prototype

### 🧱 Hierarchy of Design Fidelity
1. **Wireframe** → Structure and layout.
2. **Mockup** → Visual design and aesthetics.
3. **Prototype** → Interactive and functional flow.

### 📊 1. Wireframe
- Skeleton view of screens.
- Defines content placement, navigation, and screen relationships.
- Answers: *“Where does what go?”*

### 🎨 2. Mockup
- Adds colors, fonts, images, and branding.
- Represents the *final look* of the product.
- Useful for stakeholder buy-in and early design feedback.

### ⚙️ 3. Prototype
- Brings interaction to life — clickable and navigable.
- Used for **usability testing** and **pitching to investors**.
- Can be low- or high-fidelity based on project phase.

### 🔁 Workflow Summary
1. **Wireframe** → build structure.
2. **Mockup** → add visuals.
3. **Prototype** → simulate user experience.

### 🧠 Key Takeaway
Start simple. Don’t jump into designing or coding — **progress from wireframe → mockup → prototype** to validate usability, design, and experience step-by-step.

## 3. Jump into Sketching
**Duration:** 9m 1s

### 🎯 Key Concepts
- **Sketching** is the *fastest and simplest* way to visualize product ideas before moving to digital tools.
- Helps clarify *user flow*, *screen relationships*, and *key interactions*.
- Encourages *collaboration* — everyone can contribute regardless of design skills.

### 🧩 Benefits
- Low-cost and quick to iterate.
- Forces focus on functionality and user journey, not design aesthetics.
- Acts as a bridge between *concept* and *wireframe*.

### ✍️ Best Practices
- Use pen and paper or a whiteboard — avoid perfection.
- Sketch major screens (home, search, detail, settings, etc.).
- Use **arrows** to indicate navigation flow.
- Keep it *clean but not detailed* — clarity > beauty.

### 💡 Tip
Think of sketching as *thinking on paper*. The goal isn’t to make it pretty — it’s to make it understandable.

## 4. Sketching out a Mobile App
**Duration:** 7m 30s

### 📱 Key Ideas
- Start by identifying **core user tasks** your app enables.
- Sketch the *main screens* and *how users move* between them.
- Use **boxes, arrows, and labels** — simplicity over polish.

### 🧭 Steps
1. Define 3–5 key actions (e.g., login, browse, view item, purchase).
2. Sketch each screen on a separate paper or sticky note.
3. Draw arrows showing user flow between screens.
4. Annotate screens with short notes — “button,” “image,” “scroll area,” etc.

### 🎨 Example
For a fitness app:
- Home → Workout Categories → Start Workout → Stats Screen.

### 💡 Tip
Sketch for *experience flow*, not final layout. It’s about how users *move*, not how things *look*.

## 5. Using POP (Prototyping on Paper)
**Duration:** 8m 56s

### ⚙️ What is POP?
- **POP (Prototyping on Paper)** lets you turn hand-drawn sketches into **interactive prototypes** using your phone.
- Converts sketches into clickable screens that simulate user flow.

### 📲 How It Works
1. Draw screens on paper.
2. Take photos of each sketch using POP.
3. Link buttons or areas to other screens.
4. Test the navigation like a real app.

### 🚀 Benefits
- Quick, no design software needed.
- Great for *early validation* of app flow.
- Helps communicate ideas to non-technical stakeholders or clients.

### 💡 Tip
Use POP to test assumptions early — before moving to tools like Figma or Balsamiq.

## 6. Intro to Balsamiq
**Duration:** 11m 7s

### 🧠 Overview
- **Balsamiq** is a *low-fidelity wireframing tool* designed for speed and simplicity.
- Mimics hand-drawn sketches to keep focus on **structure** and **usability**, not design.

### 🧩 Core Features
- Drag-and-drop UI components (buttons, forms, menus, etc.).
- Pre-built templates for web and mobile.
- Ability to create multiple screens and link them for flow testing.

### 🎯 Advantages
- Extremely easy to learn — minimal design experience needed.
- Encourages collaboration between PMs, designers, and engineers.
- Ideal for brainstorming sessions and stakeholder reviews.

### 💡 Tip
Treat Balsamiq as a digital whiteboard — a place to *play with ideas quickly*.

## 7. Building YouTube in Balsamiq

### 🎥 Objective
- Focuses on structuring core elements, not aesthetics.

### 🧱 Key Steps
1. Create **Home Screen** — search bar, video thumbnails, navigation bar.
2. Add **Video Detail Page** — video player, title, description, comments.
3. Include **Navigation Flow** between screens using links.
4. Use placeholders for images, icons, and text to keep it abstract.

### 🧭 Lessons Learned
- Start with major components; refine later.
- Keep hierarchy clear: primary actions (play, search) should stand out.
- Iterate rapidly — wireframes are *meant to evolve*.

### 💡 Takeaway
Use Balsamiq to map out **functionality and flow**. The goal is to capture *how it works*, not *how it looks*.
