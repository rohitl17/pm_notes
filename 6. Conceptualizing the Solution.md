## 1. Introduction to Wireframing

### 🎯 Key Concepts
- **Wireframing** is the *blueprint* of a digital product — it defines *structure and layout*, not design or color.
- It’s used to visualize how users will interact with your product before any code or design is done.
- The focus is on **usability**, **information hierarchy**, and **navigation flow**.

### 🧩 Why Wireframes Matter
- Helps teams quickly **test ideas** and **align on structure**.
- Reduces time and cost by catching UX issues early.
- Allows for **iterative feedback** without the distraction of visual details.

### 🛠 Tools for Wireframing
- **Low-fidelity:** Pen & paper, Balsamiq.
- **High-fidelity:** Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD.
- Choose based on **stage** (early = low fidelity, late = high fidelity).

### 💡 Tips
- Focus on *content placement* and *interaction flow*.
- Don’t spend time styling — grayscale layouts are ideal.
- Validate flow with stakeholders before prototyping.

## 2. Wireframe, Mockup, Prototype

### 🧱 Hierarchy of Design Fidelity
1. **Wireframe** → Structure and layout.
2. **Mockup** → Visual design and aesthetics.
3. **Prototype** → Interactive and functional flow.

### 📊 1. Wireframe
- Skeleton view of screens.
- Defines content placement, navigation, and screen relationships.
- Answers: *“Where does what go?”*

### 🎨 2. Mockup
- Adds colors, fonts, images, and branding.
- Represents the *final look* of the product.
- Useful for stakeholder buy-in and early design feedback.

### ⚙️ 3. Prototype
- Brings interaction to life — clickable and navigable.
- Used for **usability testing** and **pitching to investors**.
- Can be low- or high-fidelity based on project phase.

### 🔁 Workflow Summary
1. **Wireframe** → build structure.
2. **Mockup** → add visuals.
3. **Prototype** → simulate user experience.

### 🧠 Key Takeaway
Start simple. Don’t jump into designing or coding — **progress from wireframe → mockup → prototype** to validate usability, design, and experience step-by-step.
