# 🧠 Notes Compendium

## 1. Introduction to Ideas and User Needs

### Where Ideas Come From (as a PM)
- Great ideas come from real user problems, not sudden inspiration.
- **Sources of ideas:**
  - Customer feedback and pain points
  - Data and usage metrics
  - Market trends and competitor actions
  - Company vision or leadership direction
  - New technologies and possibilities
- PM’s role is to **curate and prioritize** ideas that balance customer value and business impact.

### Getting to Real User Needs
- Users often describe *solutions*, not *problems* — dig deeper to uncover the “why.”
- Use the **5 Whys** technique to find root causes.
- Observe real user behavior (contextual inquiry).
- Focus on needs that are:
  - Common across users
  - Painful or valuable
  - Actionable (something you can build for)
- Empathy > Assumptions.

### Users vs. Customers
- **Users:** People who use your product.
- **Customers:** People who pay for it.
- Example: In B2B, employees = users, company = customer.
- Great PMs balance both perspectives in decisions.
