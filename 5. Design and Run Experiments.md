# ⚗️ Designing and Running Experiments

## 🧩 What is an MVP?

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is the **smallest version** of a product that allows you to **test a core assumption** with real users.  
- Its purpose is to **learn**, not to launch.  
- MVPs reduce **risk, cost, and time** by validating whether users find value in your idea **before full-scale development**.  
- MVPs help answer:  
  > “Does this problem really exist?” and “Does our solution actually solve it?”

**Key Principle:**  
> Build to **learn**, not to **scale**.

## 💭 How Do Product Managers Think About MVPs?

- PMs use MVPs to **validate assumptions quickly** and **de-risk decisions**.  
- MVPs are **experiments**, not prototypes — they must test a **real hypothesis**.  
- Good MVPs:
  - Focus on **one clear learning goal**  
  - Deliver a **real user experience** (not just theoretical feedback)  
  - Measure a **defined success metric**  

- PM mindset:
  - **“What’s the fastest way to learn?”** instead of “What’s the fastest way to build?”
  - Use MVPs to test **behavior**, not opinions.

> Example: Instead of asking, “Would you use this feature?”, observe whether users actually click, sign up, or pay.

## 🧭 Seven Steps to Running an MVP Experiment

1. **Define Objective**  
   - What do you want to learn? (e.g., user need, feature adoption, pricing fit)

2. **Identify Assumptions**  
   - What must be true for your idea to succeed?

3. **Formulate Hypotheses**  
   - Convert assumptions into testable statements.  
   - Example: “If we offer free setup, 40% of users will complete onboarding.”

4. **Design the MVP**  
   - Choose the smallest experiment to test the hypothesis.  
   - Examples: landing page, email test, concierge MVP.

5. **Set Success Criteria (MCS)**  
   - Define the **Minimum Criterion for Success** before launching.  
   - Prevents bias in interpreting results.

6. **Run the Experiment**  
   - Launch quickly, collect behavioral data, and observe patterns.

7. **Analyze and Learn**  
   - Evaluate outcomes: Confirmed ✅ | Contradicted ❌ | Inconclusive ⚪  
   - Use insights to iterate or pivot.

## 🧠 Identify Your Assumptions

- Assumptions are **beliefs that must hold true** for your product to succeed.  
- Identifying them early helps you **prioritize risks** and design better experiments.

**Types of Assumptions:**
1. **Desirability:** Do users actually want this?  
2. **Feasibility:** Can we build it effectively?  
3. **Viability:** Is it sustainable or profitable?  
4. **Usability:** Can users understand and use it easily?

### Example Framework

| **Assumption Type** | **Example** | **Test Method** |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Desirability | “Users want same-day delivery” |  landing page |
| Feasibility | “We can process requests in <2 hrs” | Internal prototype |
| Viability | “People will pay $10/month” | Pricing test |
| Usability | “Signup takes <2 min” | Usability test |

> Tip: Focus first on **the riskiest assumption** — the one most likely to break your business if false.
