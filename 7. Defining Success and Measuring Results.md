# Metrics for Product Managers: Defining Success and Measuring Results

## 1. Introduction to Metrics

### Key Concepts
- Metrics are the foundation for **measuring success** and **guiding decisions** in product management.  
- They provide **objective signals** about whether a product is moving in the right direction.  
- A good metric aligns with the **company mission**, **product vision**, and **user value**.

### Why Metrics Matter
- They help teams **understand performance** and **prioritize work**.  
- Allow PMs to **communicate impact** clearly to executives and stakeholders.  
- Help identify **what’s working** and **what needs improvement**.

### Types of Metrics by Function
- **Business metrics:** Revenue, growth rate, profit margin.  
- **Product metrics:** Retention, engagement, conversion rate.  
- **User metrics:** Customer satisfaction, NPS, churn rate.

### Common Mistakes
- Tracking vanity metrics that look good but don’t show real progress (e.g., page views without conversion context).  
- Measuring too many metrics instead of focusing on key ones.  

### Takeaway
Product managers must define **a few key metrics** that connect directly to the **product’s goals and customer outcomes**. In general, possible to measure the health of the customer but not the happiness.

## 2. Real-life Examples of Metrics

### Overview
Examples of metrics across various industries show how measurement depends on **context and business model**.

### Consumer Apps
- **DAU (Daily Active Users)** and **MAU (Monthly Active Users)** to track engagement.
- **Retention rate** to measure user stickiness.  
- **Session length and frequency** to understand depth of engagement.

### E-commerce
- **Conversion rate** (visits to purchases).  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** for customer spending habits.  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** to assess the profitability of users over time.  
- **Cart abandonment rate** as a friction indicator.

### SaaS Products
- **Activation rate**: percentage of users reaching “aha” moment.  
- **Churn rate**: users leaving the product.  
- **Expansion revenue** from upsells or add-ons.  
- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)** for stable growth tracking.

### Marketplace Products
- **Liquidity** (how fast supply meets demand).  
- **Fill rate** for transactions.  
- **Take rate** (commission percentage).  

Every product’s success metric must match its **core value proposition** and **customer behavior pattern**.

## 3. Metrics of All Kinds

### Overview
Metrics can be classified into several categories. A well-rounded PM understands which type to use for each stage of product maturity.

### Key Categories

#### 1. Acquisition Metrics
- Track how users discover and start using the product.  
- Examples: Website visits, signups, cost per acquisition (CPA), referral rate.  

#### 2. Activation Metrics
- Measure how quickly new users experience product value.  
- Examples: Onboarding completion, time to first value, trial-to-paid conversion.  

#### 3. Engagement Metrics
- Assess how actively users interact with the product.  
- Examples: DAU/MAU ratio, session frequency, number of actions per user, time in app.  

#### 4. Retention Metrics
- Indicate long-term satisfaction and product stickiness.  
- Examples: Retention curve, churn rate, repeat usage.  

#### 5. Revenue Metrics
- Represent financial outcomes and business sustainability.  
- Examples: MRR, ARR, ARPU (Average Revenue per User), lifetime value (LTV).  

#### 6. Referral Metrics
- Capture organic growth through existing users.  
- Examples: NPS, referral rate, social shares.  

### Leading vs Lagging Indicators
- **Leading indicators** predict future success (e.g., engagement, activation).  
- **Lagging indicators** confirm outcomes (e.g., revenue, churn).  
- A good PM uses both to balance **prediction and validation**.

### North Star Metric (NSM)
- A single overarching measure that captures the **core value delivered to customers**.  
- Examples:  
  - Spotify → Minutes of music listened  
  - Airbnb → Nights booked  
  - Slack → Messages sent within teams  

### Takeaway
The best metric framework connects **acquisition → activation → retention → revenue → referral**.  
Each stage reflects a part of the user journey and the overall health of the business.

## 4. How to Pick Good Metrics

### The Goal
Good metrics should **drive behavior**, **align teams**, and **indicate progress** toward the right outcomes.

### Criteria for a Good Metric
1. **Understandable** – Everyone knows what it means and how it’s calculated.  
2. **Actionable** – Teams can influence it through changes.  
3. **Comparable** – Can be tracked over time to identify trends.  
4. **Leading, not lagging** – Helps anticipate performance, not just confirm it.  
5. **Aligned** – Tied to strategic goals and user value.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Vanity metrics:** Big numbers that don’t connect to impact (downloads, followers).  
- **Local optimization:** Focusing on improving one metric that harms another (e.g., increasing signups but reducing activation).  
- **No context:** Metrics without benchmarks or baselines are meaningless.  

### How to Choose
1. **Start from the goal** (e.g., grow engagement).  
2. **Define user behavior** that signals success.  
3. **Select 1-2 key metrics** to represent that goal.  
4. **Set targets** based on historical data or market standards.  
5. **Instrument tracking** in your analytics system.  

### Metric Trees
- Break down a broad metric into smaller drivers.  
- Example:  
  - Retention = % of users returning  
    - Depends on activation rate  
    - Depends on engagement depth  

### Takeaway
The best PMs focus on **a handful of meaningful, behavior-driven metrics**.  
Metrics are not just numbers — they tell the story of **how users interact with your product and whether you’re creating value**.
